PTMPI
---------------------------------------------------
How to make:
============

Go to src and type makefile

this will make ptmpi executable, with support for block based matrix
multiplication program.

What to change:
===============

Right now startup procedure is not compleated, so you need first to change
the directory from where you will start the ptmpi on the cluster in
runptmpi.c in src dir.

How to run:
===========

Manualy:

login to each node you want to start ptmpi and type:
./ptmpi i conffile args

start the processes from i= 0 to p-1 please. It should work if started in
any order, but I did not have time to debug the code, and sometimes one
process dies durring the init and than the rest are just blocked on select.
I will change startup ASAP.


Automated startup:

e.g. start with:

./runptmpi conf_ptmpi.rc4x4 2048 32

Note that right now you need to change path for the local_script and
configuration file: this can be changed to support unix ENVs...


PTMPI configuration file:

conf_ptmpi.rcxx should contain configuration for ptmpi system layout:
structure is following:

<number of MPI nodes>
<number of processes in the system>

<node name> <listening port> <number of MPI nodes for this process>
...


This configuration must exist to be able to run ptmpi. However you do not
need to use runptmpi, you can run the processes manualy on each node you are
using.

runptmpi will execute local_start shell with appropriate arguments on each
node. You can also change local_start script in order to change log files
for each node. Initial value is /home/local_home/zoran/nodeXX.log where XX
is ptmpi process number (supplied to ptmpi as first argument).

Output:
=======

If you run the ptmpi manualy output will go to your tty. There are some
problems right now with the NFS so I am log to local disk right now. You
will need to change the dir in local_start script. Now it points to zoran
dir. Configuration file is read from the nfs, and it should work also with
output, but, I did not have time to test that... You can specify the same
dir from which the ptmpi is started in local_start to use NFS.


Known BUGS:
===========

I am using REUSE bit for listenning sockets. This works fine most of the 
time.

The startup procedure is not fail safe, so sometimes there will be some
blocked processes hanging around. To kill all processes on cluster use:
killnodes ptmpi

killnodes is the script included.

If the ptmpi seems not to run, you can try to change the port numbers in
conf file or to (works fine most of the time) just wait a little. Before
starting kill all stalled processes, if any. That is not problem with
MPI implementation, but with startup (establishing connections) part of 
code, which is not properly debugged.

Results of the multiplication are checked, and are correct. Program is still
in realy beta stage, and is not properly debugged.

If something seem to be wrong, please start processes manualy, and with
debug turned on (not all... see code for details). Startup will work fine
always if the processes are started from 0 to p-1...
